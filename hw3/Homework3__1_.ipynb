    "  By sorting both A and B in order from largest to smallest this ensures a maximum product because the largest numbers in A are set to the power of the largest numbers in B. For example, 2^32 is much smaller than 9^32, so largest numbers in A should be matched up with largest numbers in B for a maximum product. For any integer and exponet combination, the larger they both are the larger the result is. This could also be done by sorting both arrays from smallest to largest and would have the same effect.  \n",
